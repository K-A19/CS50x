              <b>Name:</b> K.A (What you'll get to refer to me as)<br>
              <b>Age:</b> 14yrs (May be young but I have sense sometimes)<br>
              <b>Gender:</b> Female (Yes I like code, so what?)<br>
              <b>Current Education:</b> Secondary School, Year 10 (Yes, I have time for this course most of the time)<br>
              <b>How I Got Introduced To CS50:</b> A friend (Joshbuild10) made me cause he can<br>
              <b>Best Part So Far:</b> I would say this one but like I can't do Javascript properly (yet) so I'd say the SQL Mystery<br>
              <b>Worst Part:</b> Probably Tideman because I got so stressed doing it to not even get 100% in the end<br>
              <b>General Thoughts On CS50:</b> It's actually like a big but educational challenge to take on.
                 Like at the beginning it was a competition of who finished first between me and my friend, while still learning interesting cool stuff.
                 It also forces you to think but in a good way that leaves you smiling when you've seen what you've accomplished when you complete a problem set or lab.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              As can be seen I'm one of the last people that you may actually see doing CS50 without mentioning things like how lazy I am or how lost I can be.
              The point is, don't get discouraged, if you get interested in actually starting the course, go ahead, you'll be able to make it work for you.
              (Yes, I may be doing a bit of promotional rubbish for CS50 because I don't know what to write and I actually really like the course.)
