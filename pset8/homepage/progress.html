                  On my journey with CS50 (it was meant to be about 8 weeks by the time I was making this but uh life and laziness) I have learned so much as well as gained alot towards my future career.
                  The cause helped me to realize what i had a passion for and an idea of where I wanted to go. Now I know I want to look into Computer Science and Software Engineering. So for that I would like to say thank you to CS50 by Havard.
                  In the areas of the course which I have reached I have learned about:
                  <ul id="course-progress">
                      <li>Binary Code and them 1's and 0's</li>
                      <li>Basics of Programming with the Input/Output System</li>
                      <li>Syntax of multiple coding languages</li>
                      <li>Types of Searches</li>
                      <li>Types of Sorting such as Bubble Sort (The easiest and the best)</li>
                      <li>Different Data Types</li>
                      <li>Different Data Structures</li>
                      <li>Multipe coding languages</li>
                      <li><del>How to die and cry</del></li>
                  </ul>
                <p>
                    It may seem like alot, but really it's an experience which can fly by while you learn more that you thought you could. The multiple problem sets and labs which I also had to complete added greatly to my experience as they
                    put my newly learned skills into practice to make sure it's harder to forget (don't get me wrong you can still forget the skills but not as easily ofc).
