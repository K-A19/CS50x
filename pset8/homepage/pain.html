               <p>I'm not going to lie guys, CS50 can be tough. Take this website for example I was so demotivated you don't even know how long it took me to make it.
                  You have to be ready to work hard. You may feel like having a breakdown because smthin isn't working out how you want it to but at that point you need to take a break, grab a glass of water and even rest a bit.
                  Once your refreshed, come back to the code with fresh mind and you'll be able to work through and see your mistake. And if that doesn't work, ask some friends! I know I did that <del><b><i>alot</i></b></del> only once or twice.</p>
               <p>But seriouly despite how painful it can seem, the feeling you get once you've ccompleted a little project that was given as a task is amazing.
                  You can feel over the moon and forget what ever 'pain' you went through because you feel truly accomplished.
                  If your one for challeneges this is for you, even if you don't like coding or your not sure your into it, well why not just try the course because you can go at your on pace and don't even have to complete it if you don't want to.
                  In that case just take the free option. Best part is it has everything you'll need to go on with the course, all you need is a device and you can access the course anywhere you go. So what are you waiting for? Why not <del><i>suffer</i></del>
                  have fun and click on this like link - <a id="cs50_link" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/">CS50</a>. You know you want to..... go on.....
