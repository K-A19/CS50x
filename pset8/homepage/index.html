          <p> Hello! Well this is my simple site im doing for my CS50 problem set 8 I hope you have time to listen to my little bit of work.</p>
          <p> This site is going to be about the truly wonderful and intresting CS50 course I am currently on.
              So generally put, CS50 is a course aimed at teaching you the general basics of computer science such as how it's just a way of solvinga given problem.
              You actually get to learn about different coding languages such as:
              <ul id="languages">
                <li>C</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>SQl</li>
                <li>Html</li>
                <li>Javacript</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
              </ul>
          <p> Well yes looking at it, learning that many in about an estimate of 12 weeks seems a little to much at once,
              but in actuallity after learnig he basics of most coding languages through C, it becomes quite easier because all your doing is changing syntax,not the general idea.</p>
          <p> This course can actually be done for free and is by one of the best Ivy Leage schools in the UK - Harvard.
              The main directors and teachers in the course are David J. Malan, Doug Llyod and Brain Yu.
              You can actually still pay for the course for extra ceritfications and tests but you are still able to receive asmaller certification for the completion of the course.</p>
